==========================
System Requirements
==========================

For the current version of Zenom, you will also need 
Qt version 5.15.2, Qwt version 6.2.0 installed on your system.


==========================
To run zenom
==========================
Qwt 6.2.0 library and below installations are sufficient to run zenom:
sudo apt-get install libqt5widgets5 libqt5opengl5 libqt5opengl5-dev


==========================
Building Zenom
==========================

Zenom uses qmake to build all its components and examples. 

If you don't already have qmake installed on your system you can grab 
it from http://qt-project.org, use Qt version 5.15.2 or later and qmake version 3.1 or later. 


==========================

If you have installed a shared library it's path has to be known to 
the run-time linker of your operating system. On Linux systems read
"man ldconfig" ( or google for it ). Another option is to use
the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. You can use like below:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:full/path/of/library
